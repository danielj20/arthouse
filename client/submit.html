      <section class="intro">
        <p>
          Arthouse exists to champion bold, personal filmmaking from the next
          generation. We believe in experimentation, imperfection, and the soul
          behind the shot. We’re not here for trends — we’re here for truth on
          screen. Submit work that says something, feels something, risks
          something.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every film submitted is watched by one of our curators — working
          filmmakers, editors, or critics — who provide thoughtful, constructive
          feedback. Selected works appear in <strong>The Drop</strong>, our
          weekly curation of emerging shorts.
        </p>

      <section class="guidelines">
        <h2>Submission Guidelines</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Eligibility:</strong> Open to filmmakers aged 16–25.
            Submissions must be your original work. Collaborative pieces are
            welcome as long as all contributors are credited.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Length:</strong> Short films up to
            <strong>15 minutes</strong> (including credits).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Genre & Style:</strong> All genres, all tones, all mediums.
            Narrative, documentary, experimental, animation — we want work with
            perspective, voice, and emotion.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Submission Format:</strong> Upload your film as a private
            Vimeo or YouTube link (password-protected if you prefer). Include a
            short description (100 words max) and a still or poster image.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Language:</strong> Non-English films must include English
            subtitles.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Rights:</strong> You retain full ownership of your work. By
            submitting, you grant Arthouse non-exclusive rights to stream your
            film on our platform and feature excerpts for promotional purposes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Originality:</strong> Do not submit content you don’t own or
            control. Any copyrighted material (music, clips, imagery) must be
            cleared by you.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Feedback:</strong> Every submission receives a curator
            review within 10 days. Reviews are private by default unless your
            film is selected for The Drop.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Selection:</strong> Films chosen for The Drop will be
            featured on the site for one week, alongside a written critique and
            community rating. Selected filmmakers will be contacted directly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Resubmission:</strong> You may submit the same project for
            future Drops if significant changes have been made.
          </li>

        <h2>Our Ethos</h2>
        <p>
          We don’t believe in gatekeeping, but we do believe in taste. What we
          value most is voice — your unique way of seeing the world. We want
          work that makes people feel something they didn’t expect to. That
          could mean a single frame that lingers, a story told with nothing but
          silence, or a chaotic burst of color that refuses to resolve. Bring
          the things that keep you up at night. Bring the work that could only
          come from you.
        </p>

      <section class="legal">
        <h2>Legal & Rights Notice</h2>
        <p>By submitting, you confirm that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You hold all necessary rights to the work submitted.</li>
          <li>
            You grant Arthouse a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to stream,
            host, and promote your film within the platform and associated
            channels.
          </li>
          <li>
            Arthouse may use excerpts, stills, or quotes from your film or its
            review for editorial or promotional purposes.
          </li>
          <li>
            You understand that submission does not guarantee publication or
            selection in The Drop.
          </li>
          <li>
            All personal data collected will be used solely for the purpose of
            evaluating and communicating about your submission.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We respect artistic integrity. If your work is selected, you will
          always be credited as the filmmaker. You may request removal of your
          film from the platform at any time.
