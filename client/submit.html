            At arthouse, we're looking for the next generation of artists, and
            the next generation of art. Whatever you think that means is exactly
            what it does. We're not looking for recycled renditions of stories
            you heard in English class; we're not looking for traces of a
            painting you had on a Pinterest board. Show us something that's
            never been seen before, and you'll have good odds of making the
            curated release at the end of the week.
