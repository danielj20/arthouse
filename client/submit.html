          At Arthouse, we believe
          <strong
            >cinema has the power to change the world, and that the youth have
            the power to change cinema.</strong
          >
          That's why we've created a dedicated space for young filmmakers aged
          16–25 to share their short films with a supportive community and
          receive meaningful feedback.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every film submitted is watched by one of our curators — working
          filmmakers, editors, or critics — who provide thoughtful, constructive
          feedback. Selected works appear in <strong>The Drop</strong>, our
          weekly curation of the best emerging shorts.

      <section class="guidelines">
        <h2>Submission Guidelines</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Eligibility:</strong> Open to filmmakers aged 16–25.
            Submissions must be your original work. Collaborative pieces are
            welcome as long as all contributors are credited.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Length:</strong> Short films up to
            <strong>15 minutes</strong> (including credits).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Genre & Style:</strong> We're looking for fiction short
            films of any genre, any tone, and any medium. We want work with
            perspective, voice, and emotion. We don't want music videos,
            documentaries, or advertisements.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Submission Format:</strong> Upload your file by clicking the
            link at the bottom of this page. Accepted formats: MP4, MOV. We
            won't reject a film for its aspect ratio, but it's suggested to
            stick to the standards (16:9, 4:3, 1:1).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Language:</strong> Non-English films must include English
            subtitles.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Rights:</strong> You retain full ownership of your work. By
            submitting, you grant Arthouse non-exclusive rights to stream your
            film on our platform and feature excerpts for promotional purposes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Originality:</strong> Do not submit content you don’t own or
            control. Any copyrighted material (music, clips, imagery) must be
            cleared by you.
          </li>

        <h2>Our Process</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Feedback:</strong> Every submission receives a curator
            review within 10 days. Reviews are private by default unless your
            film is selected for The Drop.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Selection:</strong> Films chosen for The Drop will be
            featured on the site for one week, alongside a written critique and
            community rating. Selected filmmakers will be contacted directly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Resubmission:</strong> You may submit the same project for
            future Drops if significant changes have been made. We reserve the
            right to decide what "significant" means. If your film has already
            been selected for The Drop, it cannot be resubmitted.
          </li>

        <h2>Our Ethos</h2>
        <p>
          We don’t believe in gatekeeping, but we do believe in taste. What we
          value most is voice — your unique way of seeing the world. We want
          work that makes people feel something they didn’t expect to. That
          could mean a single frame that lingers, a story told with nothing but
          silence, or a chaotic burst of color that refuses to resolve. Bring
          the things that keep you up at night. Bring the work that could only
          come from you.
        </p>

      <section class="legal">
        <h2>Legal & Rights Notice</h2>
        <p>By submitting, you confirm that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You hold all necessary rights to the work submitted.</li>
          <li>
            You grant Arthouse a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to stream,
            host, and promote your film within the platform and associated
            channels.
          </li>
          <li>
            Arthouse may use excerpts, stills, or quotes from your film or its
            review for editorial or promotional purposes.
          </li>
          <li>
            You understand that submission does not guarantee publication or
            selection in The Drop.
          </li>
          <li>
            All personal data collected will be used solely for the purpose of
            evaluating and communicating about your submission.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We respect artistic integrity. If your work is selected, you will
          always be credited as the filmmaker. You may request removal of your
          film from the platform at any time.
