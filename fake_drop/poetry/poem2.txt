    If the stars fell; night's nameless dreams
    Of bliss and blasphemy came true,
    If skies were green and snow were gold,
    And you loved me as I love you;

    O long light hands and curled brown hair,
    And eyes where sits a naked soul;
    Dare I even then draw near and burn
    My fingers in the aureole?

    Yes, in the one wise foolish hour
    God gives this strange strength to a man.
    He can demand, though not deserve,
    Where ask he cannot, seize he can.
