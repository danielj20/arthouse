    Come now, my Muse, do thou inspire my pen,
    To sing, with worthy strain, my country's praise,
    But not to hide the faults within my ken,
    By tricks of art, or studied, verbal maze,
    To play on him who reads with careless gaze,
    To whom each thought upon a printed page.
    Is gospel truth, nor e'er with wile betrays;
    From this, oh, steer me clear, nor let the rage
    Of prejudic'd and narrow minds, my thoughts engage.

    Oh, Canada! the land where first I saw
    The blue of heav'n, and bursting light of day,
    Where breezes warm and mild, and breezes raw,
    First o'er my boyhood's eager face did play,
    As o'er the hills I stepp'd my joyful way.
    Held by a loving hand, I went along
    Thro' shelter'd wood, or by some shaded bay,
    And ever, as I went, I sang a song,
    With sylvan joy, amid a sylvan throng.
